st Layer settings

To get the best 1st layer and adhesion we recommend the following settings:

    150% 1st layer width
    0.3mm 1st layer height
    Print SLOW 25-30% speed or 20mm/s
    Use a skirt set 2-3mm from the part with 2-3 outlines. Use this to adjust/check the leveling result.
    Use the Babystepping feature mentioned on the previous page to live adjust your Z height.
