Step 5: Since I am needing the configuration files for the BL Touch and not wanting it with high speed, I would access the following file location. Configuration Files => E3V2 Templates => BLTouch-3x3.
Step 6: In the BLTouch-3x3 folder select both Config.h & config_adv.h files, right click them and select copy.
Step 7: Go to the Marlin section, right click and paste to replace the existing Config.h & config_adv.h files with the ones from the BLTouch-3x3 folder.

A question I have before doing step 10 above (compiling the firmware) is there anything I need to delete and remove from the root folder or everything is fine left in the root folder and can continue with step 10 compiling the build?
Step 10: Compile Build with checkmark icon.
Step 11: Grab the newly created .bin file and put on empty SD card.
Step 12: Plug SD card into printer which should be powered off.
Step 11: Power printer on and printer should flash to the new firmware.
Once printer is fully flashed and at the menu screen, you can access the printers info section and see the updated firmware there.
Step 12: Once you have the firmware flashed, reset EEPROM and delete the .bin file from the SD card.
Step 13: Launch your slicer software as we need to now make a few changes to your machine.
Step 14: Change your build size Z-axis to 350mm to match what was changed in the firmware.
Step 15: In your Start G-Code add both M420 S1 & G29.
